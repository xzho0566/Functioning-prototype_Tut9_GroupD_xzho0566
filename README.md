# Interact work
The animation effect of my work is that when the page loads, the animation starts in a few seconds, drawing the image line by line. When the image palette is drawn, the animation of the waves and fish continues, simulating a real dynamic effect. With Perlin's noise algorithm, the user can experience the animation effect with a realistic feel.

## Perlin noise and randomness
The properties of the animation I created are the dynamic generation and movement of the waves and the random movement and swim trajectory of the fish. Because the Perlin noise algorithm is used to achieve the effect, it is the same as the user input sound.

## Inspiration
Inspiration came from waves and fish swimming in nature. Also viewed some animations for reference. By reviewing the code given by Perlin noise and quiz in the week 10 class to find ideas to change the effect in my own code.

## Technical explanation
After many attempts, I found that when doing the Perlin noise and randomness part of the fish, it would conflict with the previous code making the background of the finished image platte disappear. So I made this image platte with the underwater view as a continuous animation.

So I made this image platte with the underwater view as a continuous animation. In my search for a suitable Perlin noise effect, I once again researched what Perlin noise is, studying it in the art of code website.
